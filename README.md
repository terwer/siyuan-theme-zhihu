üëª Ahem, here are the easter egg functions üëª

- Temporarily turn on eye protection mode

  Open the developer tool, enter the following js code and press Enter, you can temporarily switch to the eye protection mode

  ```js
  document.querySelector("html").setAttribute("data-theme-mode", "green")
  ```

- Permanently turn on eye protection mode

  Note: The current theme is 100% pure css, so the custom mode cannot be switched automatically. If you want to permanently default to the eye protection mode, you can add the above js code to the js fragment.

  Add the following js code to the js fragment to switch to eye protection mode

  ```js
  document.querySelector("html").setAttribute("data-theme-mode", "green")
  ```

  If you need to cancel, disable this js fragment and restart Siyuan.
